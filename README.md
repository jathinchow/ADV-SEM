Genomic, Proteomic, and Structural Data Analysis
This project focuses on integrating and analyzing simulated genomic, proteomic, and structural data to predict off-target effects, drug resistance mechanisms, and 
identify potential biomarkers.


Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Execute the script to perform data analysis and visualization.

Data Description
The project uses simulated datasets for:
Genomic Data: Includes gene expression levels and mutation rates.
Proteomic Data: Includes protein concentrations and binding affinities.
Structural Data: Includes structural stability and solubility.


Analysis
The script performs several analyses:
Data Integration: Merges genomic, proteomic, and structural data into a single DataFrame.
Off-Target Effects Prediction: Computes an off-target score using mutation rate, binding affinity, and stability.
Drug Resistance Mechanisms Prediction: Calculates a resistance score based on gene expression levels and mutation rates.
Biomarker Identification: Identifies potential biomarkers by analyzing mutation rates.


Visualization
The script generates the following visualizations:
Gene Expression Levels: Bar plot showing gene expression levels.
Binding Affinity vs. Structural Stability: Scatter plot of binding affinity versus structural stability.
Off-Target Scores Distribution: Histogram displaying the distribution of off-target scores.
Potential Biomarkers: Bar plot highlighting genes with high mutation rates.


Summary Report
The script outputs a summary report that includes:
Top 5 biomarkers based on mutation rate.
Descriptive statistics of the integrated data.
